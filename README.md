# SPLITCOIN

Keeping tabs of our credits and debts has always been a difficult job.
When we go out with our friends or colleagues, we might borrow money from them 
and it is difficult to keep note of every transaction. 
Often people save this information in a notebook or on phone and perform difficult calculations,
which is susceptible to error.

Our aim in this project is to make this process easier, error free and time
saving. We simplify the problem by making a program which will not only
save the transactions but also minimizes the number of transactions 
involved within the group. 

Splitcoin minimizes the total number of transactions made within a
group. It asks the user for the name of the creditor, debtor and the
debt amount and outputs the minimized number of transactions.


## Tech Stack

The project is developed using **C++ programming language**.

**Data Structure Used**: Graph

**Algorithm Used**: Dinic's Maximum Flow Algorithm

**File Handling** has been used to store the given transactions.
